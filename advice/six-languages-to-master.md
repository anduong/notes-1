# Six languages to master

https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/07/27/six-languages-to-master/

## Python

* easy to learn
* extremely legible
* good at a lot of things
* great libraries
* gets people programming *quickly*

> People who are getting started in programming want to *do* things that are macroscopically interesting from a beginner's perspective. They don't want to learn about algorithms and how compilers work because none of that is interesting until they learn more of the computer science that motivates the understanding of why these things are important.

## C

* builds confidence in understanding performance
* there's a lot of computer science that becomes inaccesible if one sticks to higher-level languages
* universal, and will remain the de facto mid-level language for the forseeable future

## Ocaml

* described as "functional C" for its elegance
* Fast and simple
* Strong functional programming support
* Forces programming from the bottom up

> Instead of creating vague "objects" that might be hacked into bloated nonsense over the lifespan of a codebase, developers create datatypes out of simpler ones, and use referentially transparent functions as the basic building blocks of most of their programs.
>
> This bottom up structure forces people to build programs on sound principles.
