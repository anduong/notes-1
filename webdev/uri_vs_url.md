# The difference between URIs and URLs

* [Stack Overflow - what's the difference between a URI and a URL?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/176264/whats-the-difference-between-a-uri-and-a-url/1984225#1984225)

**URIs identify, and URLs locate**. However, locations are also identifications, so every URL is also a URI, but there are URIs which are not URLs.

## Example

*Roger Pate* is a name, which is an identification (URI), but not a location (URL).

*4914 West Bay Street, Nassau, Bahamas* is a location (URL), and uniquely identifies someone (so long as they live alone), so it is also a URI.

However, *Roger Pate* isn't suitable as URN because it's not globally unique, but even if it was, it might not be unique forever.
