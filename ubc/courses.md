## CPSC 344: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction

<http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs344/current-term/index.html>

Fast-paced, hands-on, and project-based. Teaches how to critique, analyze, prototype, create and evaluate user interfaces. Provides advice on how to apply HCI practices in the face of real-world constraints and challenges.

## CPSC 404: Advanced Database Systems

<http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs404/outline_404_2013w.pdf>

Focuses on the internals and performance issues of building a RDBMS. Covers storage mechanisms, indexing, query evaluation and optimization. Teaches selected research topics such as data mining, data warehouses, online analytical processing, and information retrieval.

## CPSC 406: Computational Optimization

<http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs406/course.html>

Formulation and analysis of algorithms for continuous and discrete optimization problems. Linear, nonlinear, network, dynamic and integer optimization. Large-scale problems. Software packages and their implementation. Duality theory and sensitivity.

## CPSC 410: Advanced Software Engineering

<http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs410>

Specification, design, construction and validation of multi-version software systems. Teaches how to design, build and evaluate large, multi-version, multi-component software projects.

## CPSC 418: Parallel Computation

<https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/main?dept=CPSC&course=418>

Algorithms, architectures, and programming paradigms for parallel computation. Shared memory, message passing, and data parallel architectures and programming models. Parallel algorithms including reduce, scan and sorting networks. Reasoning about the correctness of parallel programs. Performance analysis and measurement for parallel programs. Demonstration of these concepts with Erlang.


## CPSC 420: Advanced Algorithm Design and Analysis

<http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~kirk/cs420/pdf/geninfo.pdf>

Algorithm design techniques, analysis techniques, advanced data structures, intrinsic complexity analysis, problem settings and other computational frameworks.

## CPSC 421: Introduction to Theory of Computing

<https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/main?dept=CPSC&course=421>

Characterizations of computability using machines, languages and functions. Univerality, equivalence and Church's thesis. Unsolvable problems. Restricted models of computation. Finite automata, grammars and formal languages.

## CPSC 422: Intelligent Systems

<http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/cs422/2012/>

Principles and techniques underlying the design, implementation and evaluation of intelligent computational systems. Applications of artificial intelligence to natural language understanding, image understanding and computer-based expert and advisor systems. Advanced symbollic programming methodology.

## CPSC 425: Computer Vision

<http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~woodham/cpsc425/>

Introduction to the processing and interpretation of images. Covers image sensing, sampling and filtering. Algorithms for color analysis, texture description, stereo imaging, motion interpretation, 3D shape recovery and recognition.

## CPSC 430: Computers and Society

<http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~kevinlb/teaching/cs430/>

Explores the interplay between information technology and society, with an emphasis on ethical issues. Provides a greater understanding of the social and ethical implications of computer use and abuse, an improved ability to think critically and defend their decisions logically, and a greater appreciation for alternate points of view. The focus of the course is on reading, writing and discussion; each week students will complete an assigned reading, write a mini-essay in response, and evaluate the written work of others.
