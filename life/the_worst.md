# The Worst

> The basic premise of the worst is that both ideas and material possessions should be tools that serve us, rather than things we live in service to. When that relationship with material possessions is inverted, the result is consumerism. When that relationship with ideas is inverted, the result is ideology or religion.

> Partisans of *the worst* will get 15 sets of cutlery for fifty cents at the neighborhood thrift shop, and as a result, won't have the slightest reservation if their friends simultaneously decide to start a band that uses nothing but spoons for instruments. Partisans of *the worst* won't give a shit if someone drops a dish while people are hanging out in the kitchen. They can push their crappy bicycle to the limit without worrying if it gets scratched — without even being too concerned about it getting stolen. They can play a spontaneous game of tag in the park without worrying about their clothes getting messed up, or go for an impromptu hike without worrying about their shoes getting scuffed or dirty.

> Internet research isn't necessarily the same as understanding. No matter how much research they do, a partisan of *the best* might not ever know as much about motorcycles as the partisan of *the worst* who takes a series of hare-brained cross-country motorcycle trips on a bike that barely runs, and ends up learning a ton about how to fix their constantly breaking bike along the way.

> Some amongst *the best* will resort to a resources perspective and say that in this increasingly disposable world, it's refreshingly responsible for those of the best to be making quality long-term buying decisions. But we’re a long way away from a shortage of second-hand forks in the global north — let's take care of those first.

> "Simplify" is about removing clutter — about de-emphasizing the things that are unimportant so that it's easy to focus on the things that are. We shouldn't be putting any emphasis on the things in our life, we should be trying to make them as insignificant as possible, so that we can focus on what's important.

> If we'd like to de-emphasize things that we don't want to be the focus of our life, we probably shouldn't start by obsessing over them. We don't simplify by getting the very best of everything; we simplify by arranging our lives so that those things don't matter one way or the other.
