# On Writing Well

## Simplicity

> Clutter is the disease of American writing. We are strangling in unnecessary words, circular constructions, pompous frills and meaningless jargon.

> The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what -- these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence.

> Simplify, simplify. Thoreau said it, as we are so often reminded, and no American writer more consistently practiced what he preached. Open *Walden* to any page and you will find a man saying in a plain and orderly way what is on his mind:
>> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

> Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can't exist without the other... Thinking clearly is a conscious act that writers must force on themselves, as if they were working on any other project that requires logic.

> If the reader is lost, it's usually because the writer hasn't been careful enough... Writers must therefore constantly ask: what am I trying to say? ... Have I said it? Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time?

> Good writing doesn't come naturally... Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the third time, or even the third time.
