# On Writing Well

## Simplicity

> Clutter is the disease of American writing. We are strangling in unnecessary words, circular constructions, pompous frills and meaningless jargon.

> The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what -- these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence.

> Simplify, simplify. Thoreau said it, as we are so often reminded, and no American writer more consistently practiced what he preached. Open *Walden* to any page and you will find a man saying in a plain and orderly way what is on his mind:
>> I went to the woods.
