# On Writing Well

## Simplicity

> The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what -- these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence.

> Simplify, simplify. Thoreau said it, as we are so often reminded, and no American writer more consistently practiced what he preached. Open *Walden* to any page and you will find a man saying in a plain and orderly way what is on his mind:
>> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

> Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can't exist without the other. Thinking clearly is a conscious act that writers must force on themselves, as if they were working on any other project that requires logic.

> If the reader is lost, it's usually because the writer hasn't been careful enough. Writers must constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Surprisingly often they don't know. They must then look at what they have written and ask: have I said it? Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time? If it's not, some fuzz has worked its way into the machinery.

> Good writing doesn't come naturally. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the third time, or even the third time. Writing is hard work. Remember this in moments of despair.

## Clutter

> Clutter is the laborious phrase that has pushed out the short word that means the same thing. Clutter is the ponderous euphemism that turns a slum into a depressed socioeconomic area. Clutter is political correctness gone amok. Clutter is the official language used by corporations to hide their mistakes.

> Writing improves in direct ratio to the number of things we can keep out of it that shouldn't be there. Examine every word you put on paper. You'll find a surprising number that don't serve any purpose.

> Is there any way to recognize clutter at a glance? Here's a device my students at Yale found helpful. I would put brackets around every component in a piece of writing that wasn't doing useful work.

> Look for the clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly. Be grateful for everything you can throw away. Reexamine each sentence you put on paper. Is every word doing new work? Can any thought be expressed with more economy? Is anything pompous or pretentious or faddish? Are you hanging on to something useless just because you think it's beautiful?

> Simplify, simplify.

### Examples of clutter

Phrases or words that mean the same thing as shorter words:

* "at this point in time", "currently", "at the present time", or "presently", rather than "now" to mean the immediate moment ("Now I can see him"), or "today" to mean the historical present ("Today prices are high"), or simply the verb "to be" ("It is raining").
* "experiencing" is one of the ultimate clutterers; just use the verb "to be".
* "assistance" (help), "numerous" (many), "facilitate" (ease), "individual" (man or woman), "remainder" (rest), "initial" (first), "implement" (do), "sufficient" (enough), "attempt" (try), "referred to as" (called) and hundreds more.
* "with the possible exception of" (except), "due to the fact that" (because), "he totally lacked the ability to" (he couldn't), "until such time as" (until), "for the purpose of" (for).

Slippery new fad words: paradigm and parameter, prioritize and potentialize.

Phrases with which we explain how we propose to go about our explaining: "I might add", "It should be pointed out", "It is interesting to note".

Unnecessary prepositions appended to a verb: "order up", "face up", "free up", or "head up"

Adverbs that carry the same meaning as the verb: "smile happily".

Adjectives that state a known fact: "personal friend", "personal feeling", "personal physician", "tall skyscraper".

Qualifiers that weaken any sentence they inhabit: "a bit", "sort of".

Phrases which don't mean anything: "in a sense".

Sentences that repeat what the previous sentence said, or says something readers don't need to know or can figure out for themselves.

## Style

> You have to strip your writing down before you can build it back up. You must know what the essential tools are and what job they were designed to do. Extending the metaphor of carpentry, it's first necessary to be able to saw wood neatly and to drive nails. Later you can bevel the edges or add elegant finals, if that's your taste. But you can never forget that you are practicing a craft that's based on certain principles.

> A fundamental rule is: be yourself. No rule, however, is harder to follow. It requires writers do two things that by their metabolism are impossible. They must relax, and they must have confidence.

> It's amazing how often an editor can throw away the first three or four paragraphs of an article and start with the paragraph where the writer begins to sound like himself or herself. Not only are those first paragraphs are impersonal and ornate; they don't say anything -- they are a self-conscious attempt at a fancy introduction. What I'm always looking for as an editor is a sentence that says something like "I'll never forget the day when I ..." I think, "Aha! A person!"

> Writing is an intimate transaction between two people, conducted on paper, and it will go well to the extent that it retains its humanity. Therefore I urge people to write in the first person: to use "I" and "me" and "we" and "us". There's only one you. Nobody else thinks or feels the same way. The reader will care about your opinion if you tell them something interesting in words that come naturally.

> Good writers are visible just behind their words. If you aren't allowed to use "I", at least think "I" while you write, or write the first draft in the first person and then take the "I"s out. It will warm up your personal style.

> Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal. Believe in your own identity and your own opinions. Writing is an act of ego, and you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep yourself going.

## The Audience

> You are writing for yourself. Don't try to visualize the great mass audience. There is no such audience -- every reader is a different person. Don't try to guess what sort of thing editors want to publish or what you think the country is in a mood to read. Editors and readers don't know what they want to read until they read it. Besides, they're always looking for something new.

> Don't worry about whether the reader will "get it" if you indulge in a sudden impulse for humor. If it amuses you in the act of writing, put it in. (It can always be taken out, but only you can put it in.) You are writing primarily to please yourself, and if you go about it with enjoyment you will also entertain the readers who are worth writing for. If you lose the dullards back in the dust, you don't want them anyway.

> On the issue of whether the reader likes you, or likes what you are saying or how you are saying it, or agrees with it, or feels an affinity for your sense of humor or your vision of life, don't give him a moment's worry. You are who you are, he is who he is, and either you'll get along or you won't.

> How can you think carefully about not losing the reader and still be carefree about his opinion?

> First, work hard to master the tools. Simplify, prune and strive for order. Think of this as a mechanical act, and soon your sentences will become cleaner. Your sentences will be grounded in solid principles, and your chances of losing the reader will be smaller.

> Think of the other as a creative act: the expressing of who you are. Relax and say what you want to say. And since style is who you are, you only need to be true to yourself to find it gradually emerging from under the accumulated clutter and debris, growing more distinctive every day.

> Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't comfortably say in conversation. If you're not a person who says "indeed" or "moreover," or who calls someone an individual ("he's a fine individual"), *please* don't write it.
