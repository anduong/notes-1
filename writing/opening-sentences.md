# Opening sentences

## In first-person

Professional writers, whenever they can get away with it, like to begin a piece of nonfiction with a personal aside or a personal story.

Below are some examples from the Gotham Writer's Workshop book, [*Writing Fiction*](http://www.writingclasses.com/Products/GothamPubsDetail.php/publicationID/1).

Alexander Steele's chapter, *Fiction: The What, How and Why of it* starts with:

> Hello, you look familiar.

Brandi Reissenweber's *Character: Casting Shadows* begins with:

> When I taught creative writing on a pediatrics ward at a hospital I met a long-term patient, a thirteen-year-old girl who...

Valerie Vogrin's *Point of View: The Complete Menu*:

> When I consider a photograph of myself taken from several feet away I see a caricature...

Chris Lombardi's *Description: To Picture in Words*:

> About twelve years ago, my best friend was reading a draft of a story I'd written about a woman recently returned from years in a far-off country...

Allison Amend's *Dialogue: Talking It Up*:

> I've been on a lot of bad dates. A lot.

Caren Gussoff's *Setting and Pacing: I'm Here Therefore I Am*:

> I've lived in seven different states in fifteen years.

Corene LeMaitre's *The Business of Writing: Driving Yourself Nuts for Fun and Profit*:

> My first memory of meeting with an editor is of being soaking wet.

## In third-person

Malcolm Gladwell starts nearly every piece he writes with a third-person account, like:

> In September of 1992, two men wearing ski masks and full-body camouflage outfits walked into a pawn shop in Miami...

You can start with a blanket statement. Chapter nine of Sol Stein's *How to Grow a Novel* begins with:

> A writer cannot write what he does not read with pleasure.

Chapter fourteen begins with:

> All fiction writers are emigrants from nonfiction.

Sometimes, you can just be start-blunt about what you intend to do. Chapter eight of Stein's book begins with:

> This is a chapter about opportunities.

You can just tell the reader what the subject is. For example, if you're writing a blog post about unequal pay of women and men, you could start with:

> This post is about unfairness.

If you're writing about a difficult subject (for example, rape), you can begin:

> Rape is not easy to write about.

You can make an exaggerated statement, then tone it down:

> In Prohibition days, alcohol could be purchased illegally on every street corner. Actually, that's an exaggeration, but in fact it's true that...

You can involve the reader in a bit of conjecture:

> Suppose you were faced with the choice of living with cancer every day, or obtaining treatment that may or may not work, at the cost of becoming bankrupt and homeless.

Sometimes you can start with a statistic:

> This year, over two hundred thousand Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer.

You can summarize the current state of affairs, then tell how it's changed recently.

> Until recently, new MBA graduates could count on getting a job straight out of school. That's no longer the case.

Starting with a famous quotation sometimes works, but more often than not, it comes off sounding trite.

You can put up a straw man and knock it down. [Naomi Klein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Klein) often uses this technique.

> The conventional view of [XYZ] is [ABC]. But it turns out the conventional view is wrong.

Or, you can surprise the world with something outlandishly original. Don't be like most people. Don't just start with "If you're like most people..."
