# Semantics and empathy

* [Semantics/Empathy, by Adam Keys](http://therealadam.com/2013/01/14/semanticsempathy/)

People argue about words all the time. Arguing about words is fun. Arguing about words is practically useless.

## Semantics are good

An overused, overloaded or ambiguous word isn't particularly useful. "Synergize", "web-scale", or "rockstar" don't convey much meaning anymore.

**Human interaction is fidgety.** We all have differing experiences, so the way we *think* and *feel* about words can vary wildly.

**Semantics help get people in the same mental ballpark.**

**Strong semantics rarely solve problems.** Problems are *never* solved by telling someone they are using the wrong semantics.

## Empathy is better

Rarely does someone misuse a word on purpose. It's more likely they know it in a different context. Discovering that context and matching it to your own is how the conversation moves forward.

It's not important that someone gets the words right; **it's important that you find a way to talk about the same thing.**

**Figure out what the other person is thinking or feeling, and talk to that.**

**Words are a lossy representation.** They can't possibly ever connote the full meaning and nuance of any idea of interesting size.
