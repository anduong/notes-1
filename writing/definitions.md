**vaudeville** was a theatrical genre of variety entertainment popular in North America from the early 1880s to the early 1930s. Types of acts included popular and classical musicians, dancers, comedians, trained animals, and magicians.

**paralipsis** is a rhetorical device wherein the speaker or writer invokes a subject by denying that it should be invoked. The device can be used to distance the speaker from unfair claims, while still bringing them up. For instance, a politician might say, "I don't want to talk about the allegations that my opponent is a drunk."
