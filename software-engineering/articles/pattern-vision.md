# Pattern vision

http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3341-pattern-vision

Having successfully applied design patterns to an application, it's easy to develop pattern vision where patterns, like Tetris shapes, become mere blocks for fitting into the holes.

Patterns should be used to make specific and immediate pain go away.

Speculative pattern implementations pretend to remove a code pain in the future, but they rarely do. It's a form of fortune telling. It's the reason [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain't_gonna_need_it) was coined.

Patterns are best thought of like helpful guidelines and suggestions, not laws or imperatives. It's a written account of "hey, if you have this problem, you can try this patternt to make it better".

Patterns should be used to make the code better in a way that's immediately obvious to the writer.

The code should be clearer, prettier or simpler after applying the pattern.
