# Quotes of software engineering

> Clarity and simplicity are of paramout importance. The user of a module should never be surprised by its behavior. Modules should be as small as possible. Code should be reused rather than copied. The dependencies between modules should be kept to a minimum. Errors should be detected as soon as possible after they are made, ideally at compile time.

-- Joshua Bloch, *Effective Java*

> For the most part, this book is not about performance. It is about writing programs that are clear, correct, usable, robust, flexible and maintainable. If you can do that, it's usually a relatively simple matter to get the performance you need.

-- Joshua Bloch, *Effective Java*
