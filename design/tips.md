# Design tips

## Use spacing

**Spacing lets the viewer quickly identify different elements.**

* Give text breathing room on all sides.
* Don't use borders as substitutes for margins.
* Adding extra spacing on the bottom of an element can make it appear "lighter".

## Create contrast through value

Value means the lightness of a color. When light and dark values are adjacent, there is contrast between them. **Contrast helps the viewer identify what is important.**

The human eye is much more capable in perceiving differences in value than differences in color.

* View your design in grayscale to see the darkest and lightest areas. If everything looks like the same shade of grey, it's time to add some more contrast with value.
* Use Photoshop on an image of your design to experiment with curves and levels.

## Add variety with texture

* Texture adds a lot of visual richness and can give a page depth, literally and figuratively.
* A light texture should be used with gradients or subtle color transitions to reduce color banding and to blend colors smoothly.
* Use CSS3's layering backgrounds to reduce the size of the texture files.

## Shape things up

**Non-rectangular shapes can draw attention to critically important page elements.**

* Many objects are rectangular: rooms, tables, televisions, etc. Thus, curvy or irregular objects tend to stand out.
* Well-designed iconography and logos can be recognized with just a simple shape. When designing icons and logos, always start with a pure black shape.
* Tip: try arrows for important buttons rather than rectangles, and A/B test the results.

## Bring in the balance

Balance refers to the visual weight contrasts between areas. **An unbalanced page can create a feeling of tension.** In rare cases, you can use balance to intentionally create tension.

One side of a page might feel heavier than the other because it has too many elements, too much contrast, too much color, etc.

A design needn't be symmetrical to be balanced.

Horizontal balance is much more important than vertical balance on webpages, but on other mediums, each can be equally important.

* Draw a line down the center of the page to test balance.
* View the page upside down to prevent your eyes from reading text and interpreting the function of widgets.
